# Weekly AI Newsletter using MCP

An MCP-powered system that automates the collection, filtering, summarization, 
and formatting of weekly AI-related news into a concise, newsletter-ready draft.



## Problem Statement

The AI ecosystem evolves rapidly with frequent updates across research papers, 
model releases, product launches, and industry announcements. Tracking and 
summarizing this information manually on a weekly basis is time-consuming, 
error-prone, and often results in missing important developments.
