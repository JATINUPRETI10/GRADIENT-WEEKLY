## Intro
Welcome to this week’s edition of ***Gradient Weekly*** — your go to roundup of the most important developments in artificial intelligence. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or simply curious about the future of AI, we have curated the biggest updates, tools and ideas that matter.


## Big Story of the Week 
"Agentic Al: From Chatbots to Autonomous Problem-Solvers**
This week, the Al community has been buzzing about the rapid growth of "agentic Al systems**- Al models that don't just respond, but plan, use tools, and take actions autonomously.
Companies like OpenAl, Anthropic, and LangChain have rolled out new frameworks enabling Al to chain tasks, integrate APIs, and act like intelligent assistants.
Why it matters: This could be the next big leap after chatbots-moving toward "true digital co-workers".

## Quick Updates
1. "Meta released LLAMA 3.2" with improved reasoning and multilingual support.
2. "NVIDIA announced H200 GPU** shipping in early 2026-optimized for Al inference at scale.
3. "Google DeepMind" open-sourced a new multimodal dataset for robotics.
4. "Stability Al" rolled out Stable Audio v2 with long-form generative capabilities.
5. "Microsoft Copilot" integrated with Outlook and Excel on mobile.

## Top Research Papers
1.”DeepSeek-R1" Scaling reinforcement learning for reasoning in LLMs.
2.”MoE 2.0: Efficient sparse mixture-of-experts architecture.
3.”VideoPoet: Google's model that generates coherent videos from text prompts.
4.”Self-Discovering Agents: Anthropic's work on autonomous agent collaboration
